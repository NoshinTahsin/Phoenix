Project Name : EChildCare

This project focuses on the subsector “health”.

We are going to work on child and maternal health, during pregnancy and till 5 years after child-birth .  

There are a total of 14000 community clinics in Bangladesh, working at the doorsteps of rural people . 
Now it has become an integral part of health system in Bangladesh and millions of people are getting services from the community clinics. 

We want to automate the whole process of health care in the community clinics and union based health service using an android application for smartphones and tablets that will be easy to use, feasible and really effective. 

 Our app will: 


1.	Ensure child and maternal health during pregnancy and till 5 years after child-birth through automating the whole process in community clinics
2.	Keep track and ensure whether the community clinic is providing proper care to the children and use the data for further statistical use 
3.	Raise awareness among the parents and health workers through learning modules and tutorials.
